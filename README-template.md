## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I learn to apply grid in media query. I also learnt how to better name my html tags with appropriate class names and IDs.

```css
.product-card {
  grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  margin: 3rem 1rem;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to concentrate more on how responsive my images can easily adapt to the reponsive designs.
